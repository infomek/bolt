Dynamic Updates: Message list updates when project selection changes
Like System: Users can like messages (updates stored in localStorage)

User types message â†’ Message stored in input state
User clicks send â†’ Message object created with metadata
Message stored locally â†’ Saved to localStorage with project association
Chat updates immediately â†’ New message appears in real-time
Messages persist â†’ Stored locally for future sessions
Project filtering â†’ Only shows messages for selected project
