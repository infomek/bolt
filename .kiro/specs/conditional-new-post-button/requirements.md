# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that the "New Post" button in the Community page is only visible to authenticated users. Currently, the button is always visible regardless of the user's authentication status, which could lead to confusion for non-authenticated users who cannot actually create posts. This enhancement will improve the user experience by providing clear visual feedback about available actions based on authentication state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see the "New Post" button in the Community page, so that I can easily create and share new posts with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits the Community page THEN the system SHALL display the "New Post" button in the community header
2. WHEN an authenticated user clicks the "New Post" button THEN the system SHALL open the CreatePostModal component
3. WHEN an authenticated user successfully creates a post THEN the system SHALL add the new post to the community feed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a non-authenticated user, I want the "New Post" button to be hidden from the Community page, so that I am not confused about actions I cannot perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-authenticated user visits the Community page THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "New Post" button
2. WHEN a non-authenticated user views the Community page THEN the system SHALL still display all existing posts and allow browsing
3. IF a user's authentication status changes from logged out to logged in THEN the system SHALL immediately show the "New Post" button without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who logs out while on the Community page, I want the "New Post" button to disappear immediately, so that the interface reflects my current capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user logs out while on the Community page THEN the system SHALL immediately hide the "New Post" button
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL close any open CreatePostModal if it was previously opened
3. IF a user attempts to access post creation functionality after logging out THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and maintain UI consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication check to be performant and reliable, so that the user interface responds quickly and accurately to authentication state changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking user authentication status THEN the system SHALL use the existing AuthContext without additional API calls
2. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI within 100 milliseconds
3. IF the AuthContext is unavailable or returns undefined THEN the system SHALL treat the user as non-authenticated and hide the button
